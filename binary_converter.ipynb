        "You will be writing a function called `convert` that accepts a non-negative integer (1, 3004, 28, etc.) as input and returns the [binary representation of that number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Counting_in_binary) as an output.  For example, calling\n",

        "\n",
        "If you are new to computer programming, I suggest that you follow the *Beginner approach* outlined in this cell.  If you already have some programming experience, or if you are seeking an additional challenge, consider trying the *Experienced approach* or *Challenge problem* instead (or in addition).\n",

        "\n",
        "The simplest way to convert a non-negative integer `n` into binary string is begin by writing a helper function that increments the binary representation of a number by 1.  In other words, the string `'0'` will become `'1'` and the string `'111'` will become `'1000'`, and so on.  Once this `increment` function is written, converting a number into a binary string is simple: start with the string `'0'`, call your `increment` function `n` times, and return the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Increment function\n",
        "\n",
        "Counting in binary (base 2) works just like \"normal\" counting (in base 10).  You start with the rightmost digit and increment it by 1.  If the rightmost digit is a 0, you simply change it to a 1 and then you're done (e.g., `'1000'` becomes `'1001'`).  If the rightmost digit is a 1, then you need to change one or more digits in higher-order positions as illustrated in this animation:\n",

        "\n",
        "The full algorithm for the increment function for the binary string `b` goes like this:\n",
        "1. Set `y` to the empty string (`''`)\n",
        "2. Set `incremented` to `False` (this will track whether we've incremented the number yet or not)\n",
        "3. Loop through each of the characters in `b` in reverse order.  We'll call the current character `x`.\n",
        "4. If `incremented` is `True`, append `x` to the beginning of `y` and then continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
        "5. If `x` is `1`, append `'0'` to the beginning of `y` and then continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
        "6. If `x` is `0`, append `'1'` to the beginning of `y`, set `incremented` to `True`, and then continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
        "7. After the loop exits, append a `1` to the beginning of `y` if `incremented` is still `False.\n",
        "8. Return `y`\n",
        "\n",
        "Study the animation and then try to work through some examples on paper to make sure you understand how this function works.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reversing a string\n",
        "\n",
        "The trickiest part of the `increment` function is looping \"backwards\" through the characters in `b`.  You can use Python's [slice notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation) to do this efficiently.  The following loop will print out each character in `b`, in reverse order:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for x in b[len(b)::-1]:\n",
        "  print(x)\n",
        "```\n",
        "In your `increment` function you can modify that loop to implement the algorithm described above.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The `range` function\n",
        "\n",
        "In your `convert` function (which should accept a non-negative integer and returns a string representation of that number in binary), you'll need to run the `increment` helper function `n` times.  The following example uses Python's `range` function to print out the string `'Hello!'` 10 times:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for i in range(10):\n",
        "  print('Hello!')\n",
        "```\n",
        "You can modify this loop to run `n` times (and to call the `increment` function each time) in order to set up your `convert` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Input checks\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user passes an invalid input to your function, your function should print out a useful error message and trigger an `Exception`.  For example, if the user calls `convert(-10)` you might raise an error with the message `'input must be non-negative'`.  Or if the input isn't an integer, you might raise an error with the message `'input must be an integer'`.  You should use `assert` statements at the beginning of your `convert` function to check that the user has provided your function with a valid input.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generating examples\n",
        "\n",
        "The built-in Python function `bin` converts integers to their binary representations. You can use this to generate examples of correct inputs-- for any non-negative integer `n`, `str(bin(n))[2:]` will return a string of the binary representation of `n`. Note that you should *not* use the `bin` function to implement `convert`; the point of this assignment is for you to implement the function yourself, not to find built-in functions.\n",

        "To begin with an example from a counting system that is likely more familiar, the decimal number `234` has a `4` in the `1`s place ($10^0$), a `3` in the `10`s place ($10^1$), and a `2` in the `100`s place ($10^2$).  Therefore the full number has a value of $(2 \\times 10^2) + (3 \\times 10^1) + (4 \\times 10^0)$.\n",
